Why should we structure HTML semantically for something like a login form? 
I think if you made it semantically for a login form or for something else standard. If one makes it with good quality one can save time by taking their code and using it again in a useful way with only needing to change the content but not the structure of the code etc.

What are some benefits of everyone using similar semantic HTML? 
It saves time and keeps things overall more simple. If one writes their code with a lot of quality they benefit from their efforts many times over.
What are some disadvantages? 
If one makes a mistake with their coding their mistake is amplified because it is copied to multiple places. The coder doesn't need to write the code again and hence gets less experience coding. Also with repetition could come improvement so the code will always remain the same instead of gradually improving.


This isn't perfect. It copies maybe 75% of the page which is pretty darn good considering how much there is. It looks fairly similar to how they wrote it. I learned many things during this project and I need to keep trying to learn. Sometimes I run into a problem that can take too long so I'll think about that problem and I'll try it again next time but with each problem I solve I become better at html and have more tools in my tool box. Gradually I think the page got slightly better as I learned more html writing this page.
